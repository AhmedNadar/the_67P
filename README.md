# 67P

### Story
In November Philae the lander touchdown a comet called [67P or "Churyumov-Gerasimenko"](http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Rosetta/Comet_67P_Churyumov-Gerasimenko). The story behind this amazing and successful operation by [ESA](http://www.esa.int) is really inspiring. 

The motivation behind this amazing mission which started way back on 2004; is to learn more about our solar system in general and our planet specific. 

“With Rosetta we are opening a door to the origin of planet Earth and fostering a better understanding of our future. ESA and its Rosetta mission partners have achieved something extraordinary today.”

The whole mission amazes me so much, and for sure the comet's name **67P**.

### Motivation  
* Learn and push myself out of my comfort zone.
* Work with different technologies such as Rails, AngularJS ... etc
* My current contract finishes after 67 days on January 31st. 

### Goal
My goal is to create 67 Projects aka (67P) in 67 days by January 31. These projects difficulties are vary. Not all of them would be original. I'll try to mimic many famous ones such as Twitter, Pintrest ... etc but on small scale or sure. Others would much simpler. Doing so would encourage me to push to Github everyday.
